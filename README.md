## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

+ As an individual who fits the African American description and a person who has family living in the US, I find the clarification this data may offer insightful in my ability to understand police brutality. Additionally, as a supported of core Black Lives Matter ideology such data will enable me to better explain how the hazardous relations society and its minorities have with law enforcement. Regardless of the ethnicity and gender demographics in the data, I find it shocking that this many interactions with law enforcement were fatal. Especially when one considers the fact that the US has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world; it becomes apparent that the police are alarmingly present in American society. As such the clarity this data offers would be relevant for all people. In regards to the questions I would answer from this data, I am particularly interested in the proportion of fatal police encounters between various ethnic demographics. Aside from this would like to explore how mental health is affected in this context. It is sad to say that each data point represents death and an alarming reality of police brutality that so many are experiencing right now. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

+ The Washington Post synthesized instances of law enforcements fatal shootings and arrests documented on various law enforcement websites, social media and independent databases such as Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters. Their data is regularly updated and includes cases from January 2015 to October 2020. Their data highlights details of each altercation including ethnicity, gender and cases of apparent mental illness. Aside from the obvious use of news reporting, it seems that The Post intended for this data to be informative and increase transparency towards the recent attention to American police brutality. Specifically, with the rise of social justice movements like Black lives matter, such data could shed some light on the extent police brutality affects American society. The data provide information on the extent police brutality affects ethnic minorities in relation to majorities as well as how police brutality affects citizens with mental health issues. As it also provides a statement of whether the acting police had body cameras or not it will this will increase accountability in law enforcement.}
